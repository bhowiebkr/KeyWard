# KeyWard
KeyGuardian: The "ward" part can evoke the idea of protection or guardianship, suggesting that the keyboard is designed to protect the user's hands and wrists from strain, much like a ward protects something valuable. -ChatGPT-4

This is basically my ergo keyboard that I'll build with a number of tools. Some of the design will be done using Python and cadquery/OpenCASCADE. It's intended to be 3d printed or CNC machined so the generated files will be in STEP format.
